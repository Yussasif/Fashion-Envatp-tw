              I began acquired his love for fashion when he was a young boy where he
              spent his time sketching and drawing. He loves to work with colors,
              and his awesome talent has seen his pieces worn by famous politicians

              While in New York, I was employed in the Charivari Boutique where
              president of the company, Barbara Weiser, noticed my potential and
              passion for unique fashion and helped me launch my first fashion
              collection. My passion for African fashion is profound. “Everything
              begins for me with the print and fabric, which usually has some
              shine,” exclaims Faturoti. My deep African roots, as well as extensive
              global experience with having lived and worked in New York and Milan
              have been instrumental in her success and international spotlight.

              pieces are also sold globally in the UK, US, and France. Anthony uses
              his talent to make an impact on the community through a mentoring
              program he runs that helps young and upcoming Nigerian designers excel
              and compete on a global platform. Nature, colors, and artwork are his
              main sources of inspiration.
